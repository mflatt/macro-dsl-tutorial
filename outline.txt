Practice: [30 min]

 Start with the run-time core for an object system.

   In the "objects" directory,
    "raw.rkt" implements classes and objects;
    "point-raw.rkt" uses it for a point class.

 1. Implement `send` via `define-syntax-rule`.

   The "point-send.rkt" use shows how `send` should
   work. You implement "send.rkt" by importing "raw.rkt"
   and re-exporting some parts, while also adding
   `define-syntax-rule`

 2. Change `send` to statically check for an identifier

    For example,
       (send a-pt 10)

    should produce a syntax error instead of a "no value for key"
    run-time error.

    Start by changing `define-syntax-rule` to use `define-syntax` plus
    a function, plus `syntax-parse`. You'll need to import
    `racket/base` and `syntax/parse` for compile-time use. The
    `identifier?` and `raise-syntax-error` functions will be handy.

 3. Implement `with-method`.

    The "point-with-method.rkt" use shows how `with-method` should
    work. As a first cut, it's ok to make `with-method` work only when
    exactly one argument is provided.

    Hint: the `with-method` macro is easiest to implement using
    `let-syntax` to locally bind a name as a macro.
   
 4. [Challenge] Implement `class`.

    The "point-class.rkt" use shows how `class` should work.

    Hint: the `syntax-id-rules` form is like `syntax-rules`, but an
    "identifier macro" created with `syntax-id-rules` is triggered
    even when an identifier is used by itself (i.e., not after an open
    parenthesis) or when it is used with `set!`. The `class` form
    should bind field names as identifier macros, so uses or
    assignemnts of fields can be transformed to use `get-field` and
    `set-field!`.

----------------------------------------

QL, part 1: [1 hour]

 In "ql", "house.ql" should our ultimate target, while "house.rkt"
  shows a parenthesized form of the language that we'll build up to
  first.

 The "gui.rkt" and "ops.rkt" modules are effectively the runtime
  system for QL. The "house-raw.rkt" module uses those directly to
  produce the same result as "house.rkt". We'll write macros that
  implement "house.rkt" as "house-raw.rkt".

 1. Implement `form` without guards or computed field values (which no
    particular syntax checks, for now).

    The "house-raw-1.rkt" module provides a small example of what this
    version should express. The commented-out part should be at the
    end of a new "form-1.rkt" module, which you implement by importing
    "gui.rkt" and "op.rkt" and defining `form`.

    Hint: Use a `form-clause` helper macro.

 2. Support an optional expression to compute a field's value.

    The "house-raw-2.rkt" module provides a small example of what this
    version should express.

    Hint: Change your `form-clause` helper to `form-clause*` with no
    optional parts, and define a new `form-clause` with multiple
    patterns that use `form-clause*`.

 3. Add support for guarded clauses via `when`.

    See "house-raw-3.rkt".

    Hint: The `form-clause` macro could use itself, especially if a
    guard expression is threaded through.

    Are guard expressions duplicated by your macros?

 4. Split the language implementation from use.

    Instead of a "form-4.rkt" that has both the macros and the use,
    have "form-4.rkt" be just the macros, and define "house-4.rkt" by
    importing from "form-4.rkt".

 5. [Together] Turn the `form` module into a language.

    See "house-5.rkt".

 6. Syntactically check that form has an identifier, and check that
    each clause has an identifier and a question string.

    See "house-6.rkt".

 7. Constrain `when` use so that it is allowed only for guarding
    clauses.

    See "house-7.rkt".

    Hint: export a `when*` as `when`, where `when*` always rasies
    a syntax error

----------------------------------------

QL, part 2: [1 hour]

 Overview of a type-checking idea

 modules and phases

 syntax-local-value

 local-expand

 1. Insert type declaration & checking uses, given `typed`,
    `has-type`, `check-type`, and `datum`.

    See "house-t1.rkt". The "has-type.rkt" module implements the basic
    type-checking idea.

    For now, operators do not yet have types, so they can't be used.

 2. Add types for operators.

    See "house-t2.rkt".

    Hint: Define `-/typed`, `>/typed`, etc., as replacements for
    `-/coerce`, etc.

 --------------------

 Non-S-expression languages and DrRacket

 3. Given a reader, implement "main.rkt", and link the "ql"
    collection.

    The "reader.rkt" module provides suitable `read` and `read-syntax`
    functions.

 4. [Together] Given `color-lexer`, add it to "main.rkt".

    The "color-lexer.rkt" module provides `color-lexer`.

----------------------------------------

Homework:

 1. Add an `if` form for use in guards or expressions to compute field
    values.

 2. Add a `text` field type, where "gui.rkt" already provides
    `text-widget`.
